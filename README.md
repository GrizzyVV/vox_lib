# vox_lib

A free, **HELIX-native UI + utility library** for HELIX servers — a clean-room equivalent of the `lib.*` contract that
FiveM resources expect. Notifications, text UI, dialogs, menus, progress, skill checks, a radial, plus eased weather/sky/time
control and a cinematic freecam — all styled for HELIX and driven by a single global `lib` table.

> Verified on HELIX (UE 5.7.4 / Lua 5.4). Clean-room from the public ox_lib API docs only — **no ox_lib source was read.**

## What's in it

| Group | Surface |
|---|---|
| **UI** | `notify` · `showTextUI/hideTextUI` · `alertDialog` · `progressBar/progressCircle` · `inputDialog` · context menu · list menu · `skillCheck` · radial menu |
| **Cinematic** | weather (`SetWeather`/`InterpolateWeather`) · sky params (`SetSky`/`InterpolateSky` — eased fog/clouds/intensity) · time (`SetTime`/`InterpolateTime`) · `SetCinematicSky` · freecam (`StartFreeCam`/`ToggleFreeCam`) |
| **Character** | character creator (`openCharacterCreator`) + appearance capture/persist/reapply (`getAppearance`/`applyAppearance`) over HELIX's native cosmetics |
| **Entities** | spawn `spawnVehicle` · `spawnObject` · `spawnPed` · vehicle `exitVehicle`/`ejectAll`/`warpIntoVehicle` + getters · `attachEntity`/`detachEntity` · `deleteEntity` |
| **Vehicle paint** | `setVehicleColor` (whole) · `setVehicleComponentColor` (one part) · `setFleetColor` · `getVehicleColor` · `interpVehicleColor` · `vehicleParty` — per-instance colour ⚠️ *see the two limitations below* |
| **Animation** | `playAnim` / `stopAnim` — montage wrapper over `Animation.Play` (⚠️ experimental — wired but not yet visually verified) |
| **World / spatial** | `raycast` / `raycastFromCamera` · `worldToScreen` · `spawnMarker` · `lib.points` / `lib.zones` (box/sphere) · `fadeOut`/`fadeIn` |
| **Foundation** | `lib.class` · `lib.table` · `lib.array` · `lib.string` · `lib.math` · `lib.cache` · `lib.print` · `lib.locale` · `lib.timer` · `lib.waitFor` · `lib.callback` · `lib.hook` |

> ### ⚠️ Vehicle paint — two current limitations (keep until resolved)
> Full detail in [`docs/developer.md` → Vehicle Paint](docs/developer.md#vehicle-paint).
> 1. **Material support is HELIX-side.** Per-vehicle paint needs the vehicle's material to read per-instance custom data
>    (`PerInstanceCustomData3Vector`). vox_lib can't ship that — it's a HELIX engine/material change (proposed to HELIX). Until a
>    vehicle's material supports it, paint is a **harmless no-op** (data is written but unread). *Remove this note once HELIX ships it.*
> 2. **Stationary vehicles only — a car loses its paint the moment it moves.** This is a **HELIX engine behaviour**, not a vox_lib
>    bug: when a vehicle moves, the instance container reassigns instance indices and the per-instance colour data is **not** carried
>    with it, so the moving car goes unpainted (verified in-engine). Stationary cars keep their colour. *Remove this note once HELIX
>    keeps per-instance custom data bound to the vehicle across movement (can't be fixed from Lua).*

## How it loads (read this first)

HELIX packages are **sandboxed Lua states — functions don't cross the package boundary.** So vox_lib is **not** an `exports`
resource like a database service; you can't `exports['vox_lib']:notify()` from another package. There are two supported ways to
use it, and both end with `lib.*` living **inside your own package's state**:

**A) Standalone package** — drop `vox_lib/` into `scripts/` and list it in `config.json`. It loads as a complete, self-contained
library (including its own optional scheduler). Best for a single-package project or a demo world.

```json
{ "packages": ["vox_lib", "your_resource"] }
```

**B) Source-bundled** — copy the `vox_lib/modules/` (and `vox_lib/web/`) files into **your** package and list them in **your** `package.json`
in dependency order (handy when a build pipeline emits a single package). The host then provides the scheduler, so you can omit
`modules/scheduler.lua`.

Either way, `init.lua` must load first (it creates `lib`), then `modules/class.lua`, then the rest — see
[`vox_lib/package.json`](vox_lib/package.json) for the canonical order.

## Quick start

```lua
-- notifications
lib.notify({ title = "Saved", description = "Your vehicle was stored.", type = "success" })

-- a persistent prompt
lib.showTextUI("[E] Open trunk", { icon = "box" })
lib.hideTextUI()

-- return-value dialogs (call from inside a thread — they yield)
CreateThread(function()
    if lib.alertDialog({ header = "Sell?", content = "Sell this car for **$12,000**?", cancel = true }) == "confirm" then
        local fields = lib.inputDialog("Sale", {
            { type = "input",  label = "Buyer",  required = true },
            { type = "number", label = "Price",  default = 12000 },
        })
        if fields then print(fields[1], fields[2]) end
    end
end)

-- progress (returns true if it completed, false if cancelled)
CreateThread(function()
    if lib.progressBar({ duration = 4000, label = "Searching…", canCancel = true }) then
        lib.notify({ title = "Done", type = "success" })
    end
end)

-- weather, sky + time (all eased)
lib.SetWeather("Rain", 8)                                  -- ease into the Rain preset over 8s
lib.InterpolateSky({ fog = 0.8, cloudCoverage = 0.9 }, 10) -- roll fog + clouds in over 10s
lib.InterpolateTime(2200, 6)                               -- ease the clock to 22:00 over 6s
-- or compose a whole look in one call
lib.SetCinematicSky({ time = 2100, weather = "Foggy", sky = { fog = 0.7 }, transition = 10 })
```

See **[`docs/developer.md`](docs/developer.md)** for the complete API (every function, every option).

## Styling

The WebUI components ship a single shared theme — `web/_shared/helix-life.css` (the "HELIX-Life" kit: red `#F0454E`,
Tomorrow/Anton type, dark translucent panels). Restyle once there and every component follows.

## Layout

**[`vox_lib/`](vox_lib) is the resource** — that's the only folder you drop into `scripts/`. Everything else in this repo is
documentation and tooling *around* it.

- **`vox_lib/`** — the deployable resource
  - `init.lua` — creates the global `lib` table (**load first**)
  - `package.json` — production manifest (canonical load order)
  - `modules/` — the Lua modules (each attaches itself to `lib`)
  - `web/` — the WebUI pages (`web/_shared/helix-life.css` = shared style)
- `docs/` — developer + tech reference
- `dev/` — **dev-only** sandboxes & the in-engine test harness (not part of the resource)
- `design/`, `design-divergent/` — static UI design references

## Docs

- **[`docs/developer.md`](docs/developer.md)** — full `lib.*` API reference, options, and examples.
- **[`docs/tech.md`](docs/tech.md)** — how it works: the source-bundle model, the WebUI reverse channel, the scheduler, and the
  HELIX constraints it solves.
